Popular Sub Blog Posts Selector - WordPress Plugin

This custom plugin was built for a multi-site WordPress installation that has multiple sub-blogs. The site owner wanted a way to manually pick a set of 6 sub-blog posts to be displayed on the parent website. After the 6 entries are picked in the admin area, the plugin provides a short code that will display a grid built specifically for the parent sites theme (Newspaper 7).

The plugin uses Vuejs, Element UI, and jQuery.
